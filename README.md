# Train-Scheduler
This assignment was super math focused and made me to bring my algebra knowledge back to life :)

The steps i had to go through:
1. Set and confirm account with FireBase database
2. set it with my project, so i can use it and verify input and output 
3. Set Front-end, by using Bootstrap and some CSS 
4. Start with the search box (Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, Frequency)
5. The idea is to take input and store it in Firebase
6. Put validation on users input: Train Name and Destination - text and numbers, First Train Time - time millitary type, Frequency - numbers.
7. Set Submit button
8. Set the first box which is the actual output
9. Train Name, Destination and Frequency can be seen right away
10. Next Arrival and Minutes Away - calculate 
11. make sure the Next Arrival column shows am/pm
12. make sure Next Arrival is real time, so after page refreshed minutes should change 

Evgenia - TODO: submit the project on time!!!
